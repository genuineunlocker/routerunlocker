          <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
          <p>
            1.1 <strong>routerunlocker.com</strong> provides professional WiFi
            router unlocking services using a 16-digit unlock code to remove
            network restrictions, allowing your router to work with any
            compatible SIM card or network provider. The service begins upon
            receipt of payment.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.2 Delivery times are guidelines provided by network providers and
            may vary without notice.

            costs are incurred immediately. By selecting Credit/Debit Payment,
            you authorize the order to commence immediately.

          <p>
            6.1 All services are covered by our 100% Money Back Guarantee,
            subject to the following conditions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              No refund is provided if the router is blacklisted, reported lost,
              stolen, or blocked by the manufacturer or network.
            </li>
            <li>
              Refund is granted only if our unlock attempt returns an 'incorrect
              code' status.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the router does not prompt for an unlock code (as required),
              submission costs are non-refundable.
            </li>
            <li>
              If an incorrect unlock code is entered or if the technical team
              determines a wrong code was used, no refund is given.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the unlock attempt count is zero (not attempted), the order is
              non-refundable.
            </li>
            <li>
              In cases of modified unlock errors, no refund will be provided.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the unlock succeeds but the router is later blacklisted, no
              refund is issued.
            </li>
            <li>
              Refunds are only provided to the same account or payment number
              used during the original transaction.
